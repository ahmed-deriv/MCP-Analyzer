---

## Workflow Process

### Feature Approval & Delivery Workflow
1. Complete feature implementation for current milestone
2. Build and deliver VSIX + bundled server for internal testing
3. User tests and approves the feature
4. Upon approval, proceed to next milestone and repeat

### Testing Requirements
- Each milestone must include working VSIX file
- Server must be bundled within extension
- Server path must be visible in VS Code output panel
- MCP configuration must be provided for external tools (like Cline)
- End-to-end functionality test must pass

---

## Notes
- **Early Deliverable:** Special focus on delivering working solution after Milestone 2
- **Incremental Approach:** Each feature builds upon previous milestones
- **Quality Gate:** No milestone proceeds without approval of previous milestone
- **Documentation:** Each deliverable includes test instructions and configuration
